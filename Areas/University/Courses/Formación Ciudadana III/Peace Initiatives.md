The Peace Community of **San José de Apartadó**, founded in 1997 in the Urabá region of **Antioquia, Colombia**, is a unique and internationally recognized example of **nonviolent civilian resistance** in the context of protracted armed conflict. Its efforts in **grassroots peacebuilding**, **neutrality**, and **community autonomy** offer valuable insights into civilian-led peace initiatives in violent contexts.


## 1. Founding Principles and Context

The Peace Community emerged as a **response to decades of violence** inflicted by guerrilla groups (notably the FARC), paramilitaries, and the Colombian military. The community declared itself **neutral** in the armed conflict after numerous massacres and threats, including the killing of community members accused of collaborating with armed actors.

### Core Founding Principles:

- **Nonviolence and Neutrality**: The community refuses to bear arms or support any armed group.
    
- **Community Autonomy**: They seek political, economic, and territorial autonomy from the state and illegal armed actors.
    
- **Collective Memory and Truth**: The community documents human rights abuses, prioritizing historical memory as part of justice.
    
- **Solidarity and Mutual Aid**: A strong emphasis on communal work (“mingas”) and mutual care.
    


## 2. Methods of Nonviolent Resistance

The Peace Community has consistently resisted violence through **non-cooperation with armed groups** and **public declarations of neutrality**. Their methods include:

- **Public Denouncements**: Issuing statements rejecting all forms of military, guerrilla, and paramilitary intervention in their territory.
    
- **Creation of "Humanitarian Zones"**: Areas within their territory where weapons and armed actors are not allowed, inspired by international humanitarian law.
    
- **Symbolic Actions**: Commemorations, marches, and memory-building activities to reinforce identity and values of peace.
    
- **International Accompaniment**: The community invites NGOs and human rights observers (e.g., Peace Brigades International) to increase visibility and deterrence of violence.
    

These strategies are rooted in **Gandhian nonviolence** and **liberation theology**, particularly influenced by Jesuit and Catholic pastoral care active in the region during the 1990s.


## 3. Organizational Structure and Community-Based Decision-Making

The Peace Community operates through a **horizontal, participatory model** of governance that emphasizes **collective decision-making**.

- **Community Assemblies**: The highest decision-making body. Every member has the right to speak and vote.
    
- **Working Committees**: Thematic groups responsible for health, education, food production, and security.
    
- **Rotating Leadership**: Leaders are elected for short terms to avoid hierarchical power accumulation.
    
- **Consensus-Based Decisions**: Key decisions are made through deliberative processes, not imposed hierarchically.
    

This structure reinforces internal legitimacy and protects against co-optation or fragmentation—a key challenge in war zones.


## 4. Challenges Faced by the Community

Despite its resilience, the Peace Community faces **severe threats and structural challenges**, including:

- **Violent Reprisals**: Over 300 community members have been killed, many by state forces or paramilitaries (e.g., 2005 massacre involving military and paramilitaries).
    
- **Criminalization**: Accusations of collaboration with armed groups have been used to justify attacks.
    
- **Land Pressure and Encroachment**: Agricultural interests and illegal mining threaten their territorial integrity.
    
- **Limited State Support**: While formally protected under international and constitutional law, state actors have often been complicit in abuses or negligent in their duties.
    

Yet the community persists, turning **memory and resistance into tools of transformation**.


## 5. Contributions to Grassroots Peacebuilding

The Peace Community stands as a **pioneer of civilian-led peacebuilding** in Colombia and globally:

- **Moral and Political Autonomy**: It demonstrates that local communities can construct peace independently of state or armed actor agendas.
    
- **Inspirational Model**: It has inspired other communities in Colombia (e.g., in Cauca, Meta, and Chocó) to develop similar resistance strategies.
    
- **Human Rights Advocacy**: It provides documentation and testimony to national and international bodies, contributing to **transitional justice** and **truth commissions**.
    
- **Symbol of Hope**: Internationally recognized for its courage and innovation (nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize multiple times).
    

## Conclusion

The Peace Community of San José de Apartadó exemplifies a **radical alternative to war**: one rooted in **community-based autonomy, moral conviction, and collective nonviolent action**. While constantly under threat, its experience underscores the **power of grassroots actors in constructing peace**, challenging militarized state responses, and preserving dignity amidst war. It remains a living laboratory for **civil resistance, ethical governance, and sustainable peacebuilding** from below.
